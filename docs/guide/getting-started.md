# Getting Started

Dozzle supports multiple ways to run the application. You can run it using Docker CLI, Docker Compose, Swarm, or Kubernetes. The following sections will guide you through the process of setting up Dozzle.

> [!TIP]
> If Docker Hub is blocked in your network, you can use the [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/amir20/dozzle:latest) to pull the image. Use `ghcr.io/amir20/dozzle:latest` instead of `amir20/dozzle:latest`.

## Standalone Docker

The easiest way to set up Dozzle is to use the CLI and mount `docker.sock` file. This file is usually located at `/var/run/docker.sock` and can be mounted with the `--volume` flag. You also need to expose the port to view Dozzle. By default, Dozzle listens on port 8080, but you can change the external port using `-p`. You can also run using compose or as a service in Swarm.

::: code-group

```sh
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 amir20/dozzle:latest
```

```yaml [docker-compose.yml]
# Run with docker compose up -d
services:
  dozzle:
    image: amir20/dozzle:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    environment:
      # Uncomment to enable container actions (stop, start, restart). See https://dozzle.dev/guide/actions
      # - DOZZLE_ENABLE_ACTIONS=true
      #
      # Uncomment to allow access to container shells. See https://dozzle.dev/guide/shell
      # - DOZZLE_ENABLE_SHELL=true
      #
      # Uncomment to enable authentication. See https://dozzle.dev/guide/authentication
      # - DOZZLE_AUTH_PROVIDER=simple
```

> [!TIP]
> Dozzle supports actions, such as stopping, starting, and restarting containers, or attaching to container shells. But they are disabled by default for security reasons. To enable them, uncomment the corresponding environment variables.
> Dozzle also supports connecting to remote agents to monitor multiple Docker hosts. See [agent](/guide/agent) to learn more.

## Docker Swarm

Dozzle supports running in Swarm mode by deploying it on every node. To run Dozzle in Swarm mode, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml [dozzle-stack.yml]
# Run with docker stack deploy -c dozzle-stack.yml <name>
services:
  dozzle:
    image: amir20/dozzle:latest
    environment:
      - DOZZLE_MODE=swarm
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    networks:
      - dozzle
    deploy:
      mode: global
networks:
  dozzle:
    driver: overlay
```

Then you can deploy the stack using the following command:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c dozzle-stack.yml <name>
```

See [swarm mode](/guide/swarm-mode) for more information.

## K8s <Badge type="tip" text="New" />

Dozzle supports running in Kubernetes. It only needs to be deployed on one node within the cluster. The recommended way to install Dozzle on Kubernetes is by using the provided Helm chart.

### Using Helm

To deploy using Helm, navigate to the `helm` directory inside the repository and use the following command. This will install Dozzle with the release name `dozzle` in a new `dozzle` namespace.

```bash
cd helm/
helm upgrade --install dozzle . --create-namespace --namespace dozzle -f values.yaml
```

You can customize the installation by modifying the `values.yaml` file or by creating your own values file (e.g., `my-values.yaml`) and passing it with `-f my-values.yaml`. For example, to enable the ingress, you would set `ingress.enabled` to `true`.

> [!NOTE]
> The Helm chart automatically configures `DOZZLE_MODE` for you.
> - If you provide `config.DOZZLE_REMOTE_AGENT` in your values, `DOZZLE_MODE` is set to `server`.
> - Otherwise, it defaults to `k8s` for in-cluster log viewing.

### Using raw Kubernetes manifests

If you prefer not to use Helm, you can apply the raw Kubernetes manifests directly. Note that this basic configuration does not create a Service to expose Dozzle.
