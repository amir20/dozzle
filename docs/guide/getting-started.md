# Getting Started

Dozzle supports multiple ways to run the application. You can run it using Docker CLI, Docker Compose, or in Swarm. The following sections will guide you through the process of setting up Dozzle.

## Running with Docker <Badge type="tip" text="Updated" />

The easiest way to set up Dozzle is to use the CLI and mount `docker.sock` file. This file is usually located at `/var/run/docker.sock` and can be mounted with the `--volume` flag. You also need to expose the port to view Dozzle. By default, Dozzle listens on port 8080, but you can change the external port using `-p`. You can also run using compose or as a service in Swarm.

> [!TIP]
> If Docker Hub is blocked in your network, you can use the [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/amir20/dozzle:latest) to pull the image. Use `ghcr.io/amir20/dozzle:latest` instead of `amir20/dozzle:latest`.
