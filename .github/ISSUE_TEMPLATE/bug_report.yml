        I get an overwhelming of issues which take coniserable amount of time to investigate. Most often, they are configuration related.
        For this reason, I ask you to help me by providing as much information as possible.
        For issues with `docker-socket-proxy` I may not be able to help as those are not related to Dozzle.
